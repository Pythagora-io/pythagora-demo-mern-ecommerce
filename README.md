# Pythagora Demo - MERN Ecommerce
This is a fork of the [MERN Ecommerce](https://github.com/mohamedsamara/mern-ecommerce) project in which you have **over 70 automated integration tests** created with Pythagora.

## Set up

To make it super easy to try out Pythagora, we've added the .env file to the repo so basically you can start right away.

1. First, you need to install dependencies

```
npm install
```

2. Then, if you want to run the tests we created, you can run Pythagora tests with

```
npm run pythagora-test
```
3. If you want to capture more tests, you can run the Pythagora capture command, open up the browser at http://localhost:3000 and start interacting with the app. You will see that the tests are being recorded as you click around.

```
npm run pythagora-capture
``` 

That's basically it. If you have any questions or feedback, let us know on hi@pythagora.ai
